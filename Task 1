Task 1: Analyze a large dataset of fraud in financial payment services

context:
  - I have been asked to analyze a recently acquired dataset of mobile money transactions from a financial services provider.
    -the dataset has five types of transactions
          - CASH-IN is any deposit
          - CASH-OUT is any withdrawal
          - DEBIT is a specific type of withdrawal in which the money is sent to the user's bank account
          - PAYMENT is the purchase of goods or services
          - TRANSFER involves moving money from one user's account to another's
  -I will also see two fraud tagging fields. IsFlaggedFraud is fraud detected by their automation system while IsFraud is fraud that has truly occured

For the first module of this project, we will need you to accomplish the following:
    Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
    Explore the financial payment services dataset by completing the querying and data visualization exercises in the Additional Resources below

Steps:
      1. Set up: Before starting I will need to set up my development environment. Needs to have all the required software installed to modify
the code, as well as getting the code of the project itself on my computer
      2. Purpose: The ability to query and visualize large datasets helps provide critical information for which areas need additional 
investment. This is not limited to financial systems but internal computer information systems as well.
      3. Acceptance Criteria: Using the Pandas library, you learned how to explore and make sense of a dataset. In the process, you wrote queries and 
then visualized those queries in an easily digestible format that is presentable to management.
